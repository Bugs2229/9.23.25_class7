# Class 7 Week 6 HW Deliverables Terraform Guide 
The purpose of this guide is to provide th initial instructions on how to setup Terraform begin pervisioning infrastructure in the AWS cloud.

## Initial Terraform configuration confirmation check 
* Verify AWS CLI Configuration and terraform version: Open Git Bash and run the following commnads. Aws configure | Terragorm --v version
`AWS configure`

## Create Terraform file 
*Launch Git Bash and navigate to the local Terraform folder and create folder 2025oct25. (NO CAPITAL LETTERS, NO SPACES AND DO NOT SAVE IT TO ONE DRIVE.)
1. Command: `mkdir 2025oct25`
*Create a terreform authentication file in the newly created directory, verify that the file is empty and then code fron the 0-auth,tf file in forted GithHub repository.
1. Command: `touch 0-auth.tf`
2. Command: `cat 0-auth.tf`  (this command is to verify that the file is empty)
3. Command: `code .` (this command opens VS code)
4. Instruction: In Vs code Navigate and select Terminal>new terminal located to the top and left of the screen.
5. Instruction: go to https://github.com/malgus-waf/class5 and click on 0-auth
6. instruction: copy and paste the use data from https://github.com/malgus-waf/class5/blob/main/0-Auth.tf and paste it into your 0-auth.tf file via VS code.
7. Instruction: save your the data to your 0-auth.tf file (CTRl+S)
8. Command: `curl -o .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aaron-Rob/terraform-aws/master/.gitignore b` (downloads the .gitignore file from remotr directory)

## Excute and validate Terraform 
1. Command: `terraform init` (starts Terraform)
2. Command: `terraform validate` (checks configuration for syntex errors)
3. Command: `terraform plan` (creates a plan to configure/pervision the infrastructure you requested)
4. command: `terraform apply` (executes the plan)

## Confirmation that the Terraform has been properly configured.
To in insure that your Terraform configuratuion is working properly you should have the following files in folder 2025oct25.
* terraform.lock.hcl
* .gitignore
* terraform.tfstate
**Note: DO NOT TOUCH OR MODIFY ANY OF THE ABOVE FILES.**

## Example of what your VS code ootput should look like.
